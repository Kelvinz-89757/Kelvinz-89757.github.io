Hello! I am Kangyu Zhu, I recently received a Master of Science degree in Computer Science at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/). Before joining Brown in 2023, I earned dual degrees in Electrical Engineering from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) and [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/index.html).


## Research Interest:

 My research focuses on **multimodal LLMs and agents**, especially those integrating vision and language. I am interested in building **reliable foundation models for interdisciplinary applications**, with a focus on enhancing factuality and trustworthiness through knowledge augmentation and RLHF.
<!-- I have research interest on **developing reliable foundation models, facillitating applications in interdisciplinary areas**. I am also interested in **leveraging knowledge-augmented techniques** to enhance the factuality and trustworthiness of these models. Additionally, I am also exploring optimization methods to improve model calibration, **aligning them more effectively with human objectives and preferences**. -->

## Collaborations:

I am very grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with outstanding researchers in the field:

- I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Huaxiu Yao](https://www.huaxiuyao.io/) in the Department of Computer Science at UNC-Chapel Hill as a research intern, focusing on developing trustworthy and knowledge-enhanced vision-language models.
- I've had the privilege of contributing as a research assistant at the West China Biomedical Big Data Center, under the guidance of Prof. [Kang Li](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085472091), where I focused on medical imaging and advancing the visual understanding of foundation models.
